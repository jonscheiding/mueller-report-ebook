# Mueller Report e-book generator

This repository generates a usable e-book version of the 2019 "Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election".  The book is generated in MOBI format for Kindles, and EPUB for other e-readers.

I created this because I think every American should read this report, and I wanted to do my part to make that as easy as possible.

## Acknowledgement

This would not have been possible without the hard work of the New York Times transcribing the report.  Their version can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html), and includes a lot of helpful annotations as well as an "Explore By Person" index.

In respect for the work they put in, I've included their annotations in the generated e-book.
