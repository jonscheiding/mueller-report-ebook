# Mueller Report E-Book

This repository generates a usable e-book version of the 2019 "Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election".  The book is generated in MOBI format for Kindles, and EPUB for other e-readers.

I created this because I think every American should read this report, and I wanted to do my part to make that as easy as possible.

### Acknowledgement

This would not have been possible without the hard work of the New York Times transcribing the report.  Their version can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html), and includes a lot of helpful annotations as well as an "Explore By Person" index.

In respect for the work they put in, I've included their annotations in the generated e-book.

## Downloading and Installing

There are two formats of the book.

- The Amazon Kindle uses the **Mobi** e-book format.  You can get a Kindle-friendly version of the book with the *Download .mobi* link above.
- Most other E-Readers use the **EPUB** e-book format.  For these, you can download the book using the *Download .epub* link above.

Here is a site that provides some good rundowns of the various ways to get the downloaded e-book onto your device: [How to Place an eBook on your Device](https://voraciousreadersonly.com/how-to-place-an-ebook-on-your-device/)

## Alternatives

Since I started this project, someone else has published a similar e-book version [for Kindles](https://amazon.com/dp/B07R11FH4H).  Theirs is probably better (plus there's an audiobook!), but mine was first. üòè

Barnes & Nobile released a free [EPUB version](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-mueller-report-us-department-of-justice/1131278152), but it's basically just the original scanned PDF, and really hard to read on a small screen.

In May 2019, The Digital Public Library of America released a free [EPUB version](https://pro.dp.la/ebooks/mueller-report) with reflowable text and links to original documents referenced by the report.  Please consider making a donation to support their work bringing "the riches held within America‚Äôs libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions" to the digital world.
